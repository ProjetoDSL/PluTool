        <p class="text-justify mb-8">This is a tool that aims to support the implementation of the <x-anchor href="http://lesse.com.br/ptbok">Performance Testing Body of Knowledge (PTBOK)</x-anchor>, which seeks to guide, from a practical as well as a theoretical point of view, the entire performance testing process, involving a set of domains, stages, phases, activities, and steps for conducting the Performance Testing.</p>
        <h4 class="font-bold text-2xl">Who should use PTBOK?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">In the structural model that we created, there are some Profiles (<x-anchor href="http://lesse.com.br/ptbok/PTBOK/roles/performance_analyst_4BADFF8D.html?nodeId=ea6f77c7">Analyst</x-anchor>, <x-anchor href="http://lesse.com.br/ptbok/PTBOK/roles/performance_architecht_D1C5DE42.html?nodeId=41ea0ba8">Architect</x-anchor> and <x-anchor href="http://lesse.com.br/ptbok/PTBOK/roles/performance_tester_A383DE8D.html?nodeId=4a4a967e">Tester</x-anchor>), which describe the main actors involved in the Performance Testing activities. However, PTBOK is not restricted to just these profiles, it may be accessed by any individual who wants to know the Performance Testing process.</p>
